[Logo]
[Tagline: "Eliminate test maintenance forever"]

**Contact:**
- CEO: [Name]
- Email: founders@qa-framework.io

## Slide 2: The Problem

### Test Maintenance is a Nightmare

**The Status Quo:**
- Developers spend **40% of their time** maintaining tests
- **50% of test failures** are false positives (flaky tests)
- UI changes break **20-30% of selectors** per release
- Average team loses **15 hours/week** to test maintenance

**The Cost:**
- **$150K/year** per developer on test maintenance
- **2-3 day delays** in release cycles
- **Reduced confidence** in test results
- **Slower time-to-market**

**Quote:**
> "We had 3 full-time QA engineers just keeping tests running. It was unsustainable."
> — Engineering Manager, Fortune 500 Company
