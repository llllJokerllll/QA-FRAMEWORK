## 🎯 Overview

This guide explains how to configure Stripe webhooks to enable real-time payment and subscription notifications for the QA-FRAMEWORK application.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

- [x] Stripe account created (already configured ✅)
- [x] Backend deployed at `qa-framework-backend.railway.app`
- [x] Stripe API key configured in environment
- [x] Webhook endpoint implemented (`/api/v1/billing/webhook`)

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Access Stripe Dashboard

1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/
2. Log in to your Stripe account
3. Ensure you're in **Live mode** (toggle in top right)

**Time:** 1 minute

---

### Step 2: Navigate to Webhooks

1. Click on **Developers** in the left sidebar
2. Click on **Webhooks**
3. Click **Add endpoint** button

**Time:** 1 minute

---

### Step 3: Configure Webhook Endpoint

**Endpoint URL:**
```
https://qa-framework-backend.railway.app/api/v1/billing/webhook
```

**Events to listen to (select "Select events"):**

#### Subscription Events
- [ ] `customer.subscription.created`
- [ ] `customer.subscription.updated`
- [ ] `customer.subscription.deleted`

#### Payment Events
- [ ] `invoice.payment_succeeded`
- [ ] `invoice.payment_failed`
- [ ] `payment_intent.succeeded`
- [ ] `payment_intent.payment_failed`

#### Customer Events
- [ ] `customer.created`
- [ ] `customer.updated`
- [ ] `customer.deleted`

**Recommended:** Select all subscription and payment events (8 events total)

**Time:** 3 minutes

---

### Step 4: Get Webhook Signing Secret

1. After creating the webhook, click on it to view details
2. In the **Signing secret** section, click **Reveal**
3. Copy the signing secret (starts with `whsec_...`)
4. **IMPORTANT:** Save this secret securely

**Time:** 1 minute

---

### Step 5: Configure Environment Variable

Add the webhook signing secret to your Railway environment:

1. Go to https://railway.app/
2. Navigate to your QA-FRAMEWORK backend project
3. Click on **Variables** tab
4. Add new variable:
   ```
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_SIGNING_SECRET_HERE
   ```
5. Railway will automatically redeploy with the new variable

**Time:** 2 minutes

---

### Step 6: Verify Webhook Configuration

#### Test with Stripe CLI (Optional but Recommended)

1. Install Stripe CLI:
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
   
   # Linux
   wget https://github.com/stripe/stripe-cli/releases/download/v1.19.4/stripe_1.19.4_linux_x86_64.tar.gz
   tar -xvf stripe_1.19.4_linux_x86_64.tar.gz
   sudo mv stripe /usr/local/bin/
   ```

2. Login to Stripe:
   ```bash
   stripe login
   ```

3. Test webhook locally:
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/api/v1/billing/webhook
   ```

4. In another terminal, trigger test event:
   ```bash
   stripe trigger customer.subscription.created
   ```

**Time:** 2 minutes

---

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

After completing setup, verify:

- [ ] Webhook endpoint appears in Stripe dashboard
- [ ] Signing secret is configured in Railway
- [ ] Backend has redeployed with new environment variable
- [ ] Test webhook from Stripe dashboard succeeds (200 OK)
- [ ] Logs show webhook received and processed

---

## 🧪 Testing Webhooks

### Manual Test from Stripe Dashboard

1. Go to **Developers** → **Webhooks**
2. Click on your webhook endpoint
3. Click **Send test webhook** button
4. Select event type: `customer.subscription.created`
5. Click **Send test webhook**
6. Verify response shows **200 OK**
7. Check backend logs for webhook processing

---

## 📊 Monitored Events

The application handles the following Stripe events:

| Event | Action | Priority |
|-------|--------|----------|
| `customer.subscription.created` | Activate subscription features | HIGH |
| `customer.subscription.updated` | Update plan/limits | HIGH |
| `customer.subscription.deleted` | Downgrade to free tier | HIGH |
| `invoice.payment_succeeded` | Confirm payment, extend access | HIGH |
| `invoice.payment_failed` | Send payment failed notification | MEDIUM |
| `payment_intent.succeeded` | Log successful payment | LOW |
| `payment_intent.payment_failed` | Log failed payment attempt | LOW |
| `customer.created` | Link Stripe customer to user | LOW |
| `customer.updated` | Update customer metadata | LOW |
| `customer.deleted` | Handle account deletion | MEDIUM |

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Webhook Returns 400 Bad Request

**Cause:** Invalid signature or payload
**Solution:** Verify `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` matches the signing secret from Stripe dashboard

### Webhook Returns 500 Internal Server Error

**Cause:** Application error processing webhook
**Solution:** Check backend logs for detailed error message

### Webhook Not Received

**Cause:** Incorrect endpoint URL or firewall blocking
**Solution:** 
1. Verify URL is exactly `https://qa-framework-backend.railway.app/api/v1/billing/webhook`
2. Ensure Railway service is running
3. Check Railway logs for incoming requests

### Signature Verification Failed

**Cause:** Webhook secret mismatch or timing issue
**Solution:**
1. Regenerate signing secret in Stripe dashboard
2. Update `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Railway
3. Wait for Railway to redeploy
4. Test again

---

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

1. **Always use HTTPS:** Webhooks must use HTTPS in production
2. **Verify signatures:** Never skip signature verification
3. **Idempotency:** Handle duplicate webhook events gracefully
4. **Rate limiting:** Stripe may send multiple webhooks rapidly
5. **Logging:** Log all webhook events for debugging and audit

---

## 📈 Monitoring

### Recommended Monitoring

1. **Stripe Dashboard:**
   - Check webhook success rate weekly
   - Review failed webhook attempts
   - Monitor response times

2. **Application Logs:**
   - Log all incoming webhooks
   - Log processing errors
   - Track webhook processing time

3. **Alerts:**
   - Set up alert for webhook failures > 5%
   - Alert on 500 errors from webhook endpoint
   - Monitor webhook queue backlog

---
